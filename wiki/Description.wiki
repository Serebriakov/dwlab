Framework for 2D and isometric games development in Java+LWJGL or BlitzMax.
Open-source. Free for commercial use. For Windows, Linux and MacOS.

Features:
 * Projects with changeable logic frames per second rate and automatic FPS selection.
 * Hierarchy of layers which can contain other shapes.
 * Cameras, orthonormal or isometric, with definable viewports to display part of game field in areas of the screen.
 * Sprites with various shape types: Pivot, Oval, Rectangle, Ray, Right-angled triangle, Raster and Template (sprite groups).
 * Visualizers to display a group of sprites with same displaying parameters. Non-standard visualizers include raster frame, marching ants frame and debug visualizer showing collision shapes, vectors and names.
 * Tilemaps with changeable position, size, tile indexes, wrapping, automatic enframing and pathfinding.
 * Sprite maps to display sprites on huge level and check collision between them faster.
 * Collision system of sprites, tilemaps, lines and sprites within layers with use of collision handlers.
 * Physics: wedging off sprites, joints.
 * Printing of bitmap fonts with variable letter length and alignment.
 * Behavior models which can be attached to shapes, activated and deactivated.
 * Graphs, pivots and lines with automatic pathfinding.
 * HeightMaps with Perlin noise, blur, circle drawing and various painting methods to the tilemaps and pixmaps.
 * Controllers system.
 * Saving and loading objects with all contents to XML file (serialization).
